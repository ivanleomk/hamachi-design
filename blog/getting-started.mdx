# The state of the market today

Today's online world is intensely competitive with everyone competing for the same digital real estate. This makes it difficult for most companies to stand out easily because they are competing for the same piece of the pie. However, we can circumvent this problem by starting to build out a small piece of our digital web presence.

For most, this comes in the form of three possible options.

## Website Builders.

For most people, there are really only two dominant players which come to mind when thinking about building a website. The first is Squarespace which is widely used mostly by creatives and those looking to host a small portfolio website. The second is Shopify, which is used by small e-commerce businesses which are looking to build an online store for their website.

Most then choose to do it themselves because they wish to save cost and for the majority of businesses, it is an excellent option. However, problems tend to occur only after you've been using these platforms for a while.

Firstly, they have a high learning curve, which results in most not taking advantage of their more advanced features.

Secondly, they are difficult to customize to the specific needs of the business. This means that instead of helping you build the website that you have in mind, you'll quickly find yourself trying to fit your website to their vision instead.

Lastly, they tend to be bloated with a lot of features that are not necessary for the business. This tends to create problems for users when they try to access the website as it is slow and unresponsive.

## Hiring One-Time Developers

One-time developers are the most common option for businesses looking to hire a web developer. They are the most flexible option as they can be used for any type of website.

The problem with one-time off projects however, is that once you take over the project from the developer, you'll find that the original problems that were being solved by the developer will eventually return. This might come when you decide to move to a different platform or when you update product offerings.

At the same time, many of the developers that can be hired on the market today are simply using wordpress templates that are even worser than the ones that are built by the website builders. They are still facing the same problem as they were when using website builders in the end.

# Conclusion

For the average business owner, this means that customers walk away with a suboptimal first impression which **directly translates to lower sales and profits for your business**.

Let's quickly recap then what are the main problems

1. Generic tools create websites that are bloated with unnecessary code, resulting in poor user experiences and thus lost sales
2. The steep learning curve of website builders result in many individuals not being able to take advantage of more advanced features
3. Hiring developers for a one-time off project only results in kicking the can down the road when more complex requirements arise.

To make matters worse, once you've gotten your website built, you still need to worry about SEO, marketing among other things. All of which take advantage from your main priorities as a business owner and thus result in a lower sales and profits for your business.
