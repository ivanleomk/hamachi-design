              <h3>How weâ€™re different</h3>
              <p>
                Traditional web agencies today still build websites using
                outdated technologies like wordpress and JQuery while charging a
                large premium for them. We don&apos;t think that&apos;s right
                since the websites they build are not only slow but also causing
                you to lose out in potential revenue.
              </p>

                At Hamachi Design, we&apos;re a small team of engineers and data
                scientists that are using the latest technologies to help you
                beat the pack. In today&apos;s fast paced world, even a split
                second delay could cause up to 20% drops in customer
                conversions. That&apos;s why we write all our code from scratch
                to ensure your customers get the best experience possible.
